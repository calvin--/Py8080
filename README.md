# Py8080

**Controls**
* C = Insert Coin
* X = Start Player 1 Mode
* Z = Shoot Player 1
* Left = Move left
* Right = Move Right

**Working**
* Game is fully playable (1 player).
* Clock timing is fairly okay, could use some work.
* All instructions needed for Space Invaders implemented.
* Some sounds are working.

**TODO**
* Player 2 controls.
* Rest of the sounds.
* Maybe fine tune the clock timing.
* Look into supporting Balloon Bomber and other Intel 8080 games.
* Support for loading rom, right now it's just hardcoded.
